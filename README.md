# Tic-Tac-Toe-game
This was my biggest project built in Pyhton   
It was created during my first class of programming in Python  
Instructions are straightforward when you run it  
When you first run the project you will have a menu with 5 options. If you pick number 1 you will go to difficulty menu where you will choose a difficulty to play against an AI created by us. It has 3 difficulties. 
I recommend starting with the easy mode, then normal and then hard
Just for the record, on the hard mode there is just a 25% chance you can have the chance to win against our AI so good luck winning ðŸ˜Š.
The 4th option is playing multiplayer so you can try that out with a partner or just make sure it works as it should 
The 5th option is just getting you back to the main menu
The second option in the main menu is a training section where you will receive cases from in game and you will have to choose the right movement. I recommend finishing it because there is a little easter egg at the end ðŸ˜Š
After the training you go back to main menu
The 3rd option in the main menu gets you to a history on Tic Tac Toe section and you can choose form the menu what you would like to know about it.
After you read all the history you need you can just hit quit until you are back on the main menu and then the 4th option in the main menu is just to quit the program
Hope you will enjoy it ! ðŸ˜Š
